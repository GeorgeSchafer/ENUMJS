# ENUMJS

Thank you for your interest in ENUMJS. I find enumerated values useful, and I hope this simple implementation will be useful for others.

## To Use

EnumJS uses ES6 syntax (ENUM.mjs). 

## Testing

I have included the `/test` folder for my mocha-chai tests to ensure that the core functionality of the project is maintained even if modifications are made. Enjoy.
